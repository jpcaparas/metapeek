# Metapeek - Image Metadata CLI Tool

A simple CLI tool to extract image metadata from image files including JPG, PNG, HEIC, and more.

## Installation

To use the tool without installing it globally, you can use `npx`:

```bash
npx metapeek /path/to/your/image.jpg
```

If you don't provide a path, the tool will prompt you to enter one:

```bash
npx metapeek
```

Then, follow the on-screen prompts.
